# MazeSolver
This is an implementation of the code which was previously made on Scheme (DrRacket)

I have provided two implementation for the solver method
* Recursive **[DONE]**
* Non-recursive [TODO]

A feature yet to be implemented is the ability solve mazes of size `[N*M]`
and also the ability to create solvable mazes given the size
