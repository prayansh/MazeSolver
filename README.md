# MazeSolver
This is an implementation of the code which was previously made on Scheme (DrRacket). The program was a question on a 
CPSC 110 course Final offered by The University of British Columbia, Vancouver. 

I have provided two implementation for the solver method
* Recursive **[DONE]**
* Non-recursive **[DONE]**

Features coming soon
* render mazes in pics and not just text
* ability solve mazes of size `[N*M]`
* and also the ability to create solvable mazes given the size
